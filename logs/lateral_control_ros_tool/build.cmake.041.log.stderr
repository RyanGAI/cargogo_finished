  By not providing "FindAutoDeps.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "AutoDeps",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "AutoDeps" with any
  of the following names:

    AutoDepsConfig.cmake
    autodeps-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "AutoDeps" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "AutoDeps_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "AutoDeps" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
